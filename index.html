    <h2>Diffgile Chaotic</h2>
    
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <p>An idea behind this concept is very simple: take Agile-board-like view and add ability to compare the state
            of all issues on day X vs. the state of the same issues on the Day Y.
            This might be useful to track things like pending action items, to see how long it has been hanging in "In
            Progress" state.
        </p>

        <p>All data is autogenerated and with each browser refresh it will create new log for all features, change types
            and assignments.
            Limitations:
        <ul>
            <li>Generator is stupid and doesn't do real-world-like flow for issues (i.e. they can jump from "Open" to
                "Completed" and "Back" with equal probability on daily basis).
            </li>
            <li>It is very easy to get system to the condition when there are no issues on a screen (because generator
                "created" them with the date after what you specified in the filters.
            </li>
